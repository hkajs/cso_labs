<h1>-- Lab4: writing a dynamic memory allocator (Due 12/03) --</h1>
</div>

<a name="labs">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this lab you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C
programs, i.e., your own version of the <tt>malloc</tt>, <tt> free</tt> and
<tt>realloc</tt> routines. You are encouraged to explore the design space
creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient and
fast.

<p>

<h2>Obtaining the lab</h2>

<font color="red">You may work in a team of two for this lab </font>

<pre>
$ cd cso-labs/ # your team's git repo if you work in a team or your own git repo if you work individually
$ git fetch upstream 
$ git merge upstream/master
</pre>

This creates a number of new files in subdirectory <tt>malloclab/</tt>.
Note that:
<ul>
	<li> <font color="red">The only file you should modify is <tt>mm.c</tt>. </font> You do not need to fill out the team information in the beginning of mm.c
</ul>

<h2>Working on the Lab</h2>

In <tt>mm.c</tt>, you should implement the following five
functions (which are declared in <tt>mm.h</tt>)
<pre>
int    mm_init(void);
void*  mm_malloc(size_t size);
void   mm_free(void *ptr);
void*  mm_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
void   mm_checkheap(int verbose);
</pre>

The existing code in <tt>mm.c</tt> implements the simplest but
still functionally correct malloc package that we could think
of. Using this as a starting place, modify these functions (and
possibly define others), so that they
obey the following semantics:

<ul>
	<li><p><tt>mm_init</tt>: Before calling <tt>mm_malloc</tt> <tt>mm_realloc</tt> or <tt>mm_free</tt>, the application program (i.e., the
trace-driven driver program that you will use to evaluate your
implementation) calls <tt>mm_init</tt> to perform any necessary
initializations, such as allocating the initial heap area.
The return value should be -1 if there was a problem in performing the
initialization, 0 otherwise.
  
<li><p><tt>mm_malloc</tt>: The <tt>mm_malloc</tt> routine returns a pointer
to an allocated block payload of at least <tt>size</tt> bytes.  The
entire allocated block should lie within the heap region and should
not overlap with any other allocated chunk.

<p>We will comparing your implementation to the version of <tt>malloc</tt>
supplied in the standard C library. Since the 
standard C library malloc always returns payload pointers that are 
aligned to 16 bytes, your malloc implementation should do likewise
and always return 16-byte aligned pointers.
  
<li><p><tt>mm_free</tt>: The <tt>mm_free</tt> routine frees the block
pointed to by ptr.  It returns nothing. This routine is only
guaranteed to work when the passed pointer ptr was returned by
an earlier call to <tt>mm_malloc</tt> or <tt>mm_realloc</tt> and has not
yet been freed.

<li><p><tt>mm_realloc</tt>: The <tt>mm_realloc</tt> routine returns a pointer
to an allocated region of at least <tt>size</tt> bytes  with the following 
constraints. 

<ul>
	<li>if <tt>ptr</tt> is NULL, the call is equivalent to <tt>mm_malloc(size)</tt>

	<li>if <tt>size</tt> is equal to zero, the call is equivalent to <tt>mm_free(ptr)}</tt>;

	<li> if <tt>ptr</tt> is not NULL, it must have been returned by an
       	earlier call to <tt>mm_malloc</tt> or <tt>mm_realloc</tt>. The call to
	<tt>mm_realloc</tt> changes the size of the memory block pointed to by
	<tt>ptr</tt> (i.e.the old block) to <tt>size</tt> bytes and returns the
	address of the new block. Notice that the address of the new block
	might be the same as the old block, or it might be different,
	depending on your implementation, the amount of internal fragmentation
	in the old block, and the size of the <tt>realloc</tt> request.

	<li> The contents of the new block are the same as those of the old
	<tt>ptr</tt> block, up to the minimum of the old and new sizes.
	Everything else is uninitialized. For example, if the old block is 8
	bytes and the new block is 12 bytes, then the first 8 bytes of the new
	block are identical to the first 8 bytes of the old block and the last
	4 bytes are uninitialized.  Similarly, if the old block is 8 bytes and
	the new block is 4 bytes, then the contents of the new block are
	identical to the first 4 bytes of the old block.  
</ul> 

<li><p>Lastly, <tt>mm_checkheap</tt>: The <tt>mm_cheapheap</tt> routine is an 
auxilary routine that checks <a href="#heapconsistency">the consistency of 
	your heap</a>. The function argument <tt>int verbose</tt> can be used to 
turn on/off verbose debug printing.


</ul>

<p>The malloc,free, realloc semantics match the the semantics of the C standard library's
malloc, realloc, and free routines.
Type <tt>man malloc</tt> for the complete documentation.
 
<p>When implementing <tt>mm_init</tt>, <tt>mm_free</tt>,
<tt>mm_malloc</tt><tt>mm_realloc</tt> functions, you need to invoke the
following functions which simulate the the memory system for your dynamic
memory allocator. They are defined in <tt>memlib.c</tt>:

<ul>
	<li><p><tt> void *mem_sbrk(int incr)</tt>:   
Expands the heap by incr bytes, where incr is a positive
non-zero integer and returns a generic pointer to the first byte of
the newly allocated heap area. The semantics are identical to the Unix
<tt>sbrk</tt> function, except that <tt>mem_sbrk</tt> accepts only a
positive non-zero integer argument.

<li><p><tt> void *mem_heap_lo(void)</tt>:
Returns a generic pointer to the first byte in the heap.

<li><p><tt> void *mem_heap_hi(void)</tt>:
Returns a generic pointer to the last byte in the heap.

<li><p><tt> size_t mem_heapsize(void)</tt>:
Returns the current size of the heap in bytes.

<li><p><tt> size_t mem_pagesize(void)</tt>:
Returns the system's page size in bytes 
</ul>


<h2 id="heapconsistency">Checking Heap Consistency</h2>

Dynamic memory allocators are notoriously tricky beasts to program
correctly and efficiently. They are difficult to program correctly
because they involve a lot of untyped pointer manipulation.  We ask you 
to write <tt>mm_checkheap</tt> to scan the heap and
checks it for consistency.

Some examples of what a heap checker might check are:
<ul>
<li> Is every block in the free list marked as free?
<li> Are there any contiguous free blocks that somehow escaped
coalescing?
<li> Is every free block actually in the free list?
<li> Do the pointers in the free list point to valid free blocks?
<li> Do any allocated blocks overlap?
<li> Do the pointers in a heap block point to valid heap
addresses?
</ul>

Your heap checker will consists of the function <tt>void mm_heapcheck(int
verbose)</tt>, to be implemented in <tt>mm.c</tt>.  It will check any invariants or
consistency conditions you consider prudent.  It returns a nonzero value if and
only if your heap is consistent.  You are not limited to the listed suggestions
nor are you required to check all of them.  

This consistency checker is for your own debugging during development.
When you submit <tt>mm.c</tt>, make sure to remove any calls to
<tt>mm_check</tt> as they will slow down your throughput.  Style points will be
given for your <tt>mm_check</tt> function. 


<h2>Testing for correctness and performance</h2>

We provide you with a tester program <tt> mdriver.c</tt> 
that tests your <tt>mm.c</tt> for correctness, space utilization, and
throughput. 

<p>The tester <tt>mdriver</tt> reads a set of <i>trace files</i>, each of which
contains a sequence of allocate, reallocate, and free events corresponding
to some example application workload.
It then </tt> calls your <tt>mm_malloc</tt>, <tt>mm_realloc</tt>, and <tt>mm_free</tt> routines 
according to the sequence of events. 

<p>To run the tester, type:
<pre>
$ ./mdriver -V
</pre>

<p>The <tt>-V</tt> turns on verbose printing in the tester. 

<p>To run the tester on one specific tracefile instead of all of the default tracefiles, type:
<pre>
$./mdriver -V -f tracefile
</pre>
This is helpful when debugging failure with a particular tracefile.
Type <tt>$./mdriver -h</tt> to 
see a full list of command line options. 

<h2>Programming Rules</h2>
<ul>
	<li> You should not change any of the interfaces in <tt>mm.c</tt>.

<li> You should not invoke any memory-management related library
calls or system calls, i.e. you <b>cannot</b> use malloc, calloc, free, realloc, sbrk,
brk or any variants of these calls in your code. You <b>may</b> use 
memcpy and other C library functions that are not related to memory-management. In case of 
doubt, please check with the staff on Piazza.

<li> 
You should not use any dynamically sized data
structures such as dynamically-sized arrays, trees, or lists in your 
program.  Yes, you can define a global array of a fixed number of elements 
of structs, pointers or other scalars. 

<li>
For consistency with the C standard library's malloc package, which
returns blocks aligned on 16-byte boundaries, your allocator must
always return pointers that are aligned to 16-byte boundaries.  The
tester will enforce this requirement for you.

</ul>

<h2>Programming Advice</h2>

<ul>
	<li><p><i>Use simple workloads first to debug correctness</i>: 
	We provide two very simple trace files <tt>short{1,2}.rep</tt> to simplify debugging.
	Type <tt>mdriver -f short1.rep</tt> to test your memory allocator on 
	one of these workloads first.

	<li><p>Use gdb. It
will help you isolate and identify out of bounds memory references.

<li><p>Understand every line of the malloc implementation in the
textbook.  The textbook has a detailed example of a simple allocator
based on an implicit free list. Use this is a point of departure.
Don't start working on your allocator until you understand everything
about the simple implicit list allocator.

<li><p>Encapsulate your pointer arithmetic in C preprocessor macros.  
Pointer arithmetic in memory managers is confusing and error-prone
because of all the casting that is necessary. You can reduce the
complexity significantly by writing macros for your pointer operations.
See the textbook for examples. 

<li><p>Do your implementation in stages.  The first 9 traces
contain requests to <tt>malloc</tt> and <tt>free</tt>.  The last 2 traces
contain requests for <tt>realloc</tt>, <tt>malloc</tt>, and <tt>free</tt>. We
recommend that you start by getting your <tt>malloc</tt> and <tt>free</tt>
routines working correctly and efficiently on the first 9 traces. Only
then should you turn your attention to the <tt>realloc</tt>
implementation.  For starters, build <tt>realloc</tt> on top of your
existing <tt>malloc</tt> and <tt>free</tt> implementations. But to get
really good performance, you will need to build a stand-alone <tt>
realloc</tt>.

<li><p>Use a profiler. You may find the <tt>gprof</tt> tool helpful
for optimizing performance.
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

You will receive <b>zero points</b> if you break any of the rules or
your code is buggy and crashes the tester.  Otherwise, your grade will
be calculated as follows:

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Correctness (15 points)</b>. You will receive full points if your
solution passes the correctness tests performed by the tester program.
You will receive partial credit for each correct trace.

<li><p><b>Performance (40 points)</b>.  Two performance metrics will be used
to evaluate your solution:

<ul>
	<li><p>Space utilization: The peak ratio between the aggregate
amount of memory used by the tester (i.e., allocated via
<tt>mm_malloc</tt> or <tt>mm_realloc</tt> but not yet freed via
<tt>mm_free</tt>) and the size of the heap used by your allocator. The
optimal ratio equals to 1.  You should find good policies to minimize
fragmentation in order to make this ratio as close as possible to the
optimal.

<li><p>Throughput: The average number of operations completed per second.

<p>The tester program summarizes the performance of your
allocator by computing a <i>performance index</i>, which is a
weighted sum of the space utilization (U) and throughput (T)
<pre>
Performance index = 0.6*U + 0.4*min(1, T/T_libc)
</pre>

where U is your space utilization, T is your throughput, and
T_libc is the measured throughput of Standard C library's malloc on your
system on the default traces.

<p>Observing that both memory and CPU cycles are expensive system
resources, we adopt this formula to encourage balanced optimization of
both memory utilization and throughput.  Ideally, the performance
index will reach 100%.  
To receive a good score,
you must achieve a balance between utilization and throughput.
</ul>

<li><p><b>Style (10 points).</b>
<ul>
	<li> Please follow this <a href="http://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/wiki/2015/Style">style guide</a>.
<li> 
Your code should be decomposed into functions and use 
as few global variables as possible.
<li> 
Your code should begin with a header comment that describes the
structure of your free and allocated blocks, the organization of the
free list, and how your allocator manipulates the free list.  each
function should be preceeded by a header comment that describes what
the function does.
<li> 
Your heap consistency checker <tt>mm_checkheap</tt> should be
thorough.
</ul>
<p>You will be awarded 5 points for a good heap consistency checker
and 5 points for good program structure and comments.
</li>
</ul>
